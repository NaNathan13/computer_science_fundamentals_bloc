Short Answer
Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: It helps programmers to develop algorithms and more easily read what they are trying to accomplish in their code.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A: A lot of errors would arise becuase nothing is being compiled down to machine code that the computer could use. 

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
A:  INPUT first number
    INPUT second number
    IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN 
        PRINT first number
    ELSE
        PRINT second number
    END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
A:  INIT printNumbers to 1
    WHILE printNumbers is less than 100
        PRINT printNumbers
        ADD 1 to printNumber
    END WHILE
        PRINT printNumbers

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
A:  SETUP for userInput of fullName to search.
    FOR each entry in the phonebook
        IF fullName === full name of the phonebook entry
        PRINT phonebook entry data
    END IF
 END FOR

A:  var input = setup();
    for (i=0; i <= phoneBook.length; i++) {
        if (input === phonebook.fullName) {
        return phonebook.fullName + " - " + phonebook.phoneNumber
        }
    }
